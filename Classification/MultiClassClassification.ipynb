    "This lesson picks up where <a href=\"https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Classification/NonLinearBinaryClassification.ipynb\">Non-Linear Binary Classification</a> takes off. In this notebook we're going to look at solving another classification problem only this time we're going to have more than two labels (classes). The steps for solving a binary class problem are the same as the steps for solving a multi-class problem.\n",
