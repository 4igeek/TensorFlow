# TensorFlow ML Projects

I have a BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence (graduated with a first in 2024) and this repository contains my notes as I prepare to take the [TensorFlow Developer Certification](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate). Feel free to use anything in this repository to further your own projects and your own understanding.

## Start here

If you're new to all this then you're probably best off starting here.

[Linear vs Non-Linear Activation Functions](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Reference/LinearVsNonLinearActivations.ipynb) - Expolring various activation functions.

## Classification Problems

1. [Non-Linear Binary Classification](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Classification/NonLinearBinaryClassification.ipynb) - Solve a binary classification problem with non-linearity.

2. [Multi-Class Classification](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Classification/MultiClassClassification.ipynb) - Solve a binary classification problem with non-linearity.

## Useful Notes (Reference)

[Learning Rate Optimisation](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Reference/LearningRateOptimisation.ipynb) - How to optimise the Learning Rate.

[Classification Evaluation Methods](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Reference/ClassificationEvaluationMethods.ipynb) - What are the classification methods?

[Confusion Matrix](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Reference/ConfusionMatrix.ipynb) - How to implement and visaulise a confusion matrix.

## Re-Used Functionality

- [Plot Library](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/PlotLibrary.py) - which contains the functionality that draws a decision boundary (used in various notebooks).

- [Confusion Matrix](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/MakeConfusionMatrix.py) - a reusable function we can use to generate confusion matrix.
