# TensorFlow ML Projects

I have a BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence (graduated with a first in 2024) and this repository contains my notes as I prepare to take the [TensorFlow Developer Certification](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate). Feel free to use anything in this repository to further your own projects and your own understanding.

## Classification Problems

1. [Non-Linear Binary Classification](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/Classification/NonLinearBinaryClassification.ipynb) - Solve a binary classification problem with non-linearity.

## Re-Used Functionality

- [Plot Library](https://github.com/4igeek/TensorFlow/blob/main/PlotLibrary.py) - which contains the functionality that draws a decision boundary (used in various notebooks).
