# TensorFlow ML Projects

I have a BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence (graduated in 2024) and this repository contains my notes as I prepare to take the [TensorFlow Developer Certification](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate).

1. [Non-Linear Binary Classification](https://github.com/VilPeas/TensorFlow/blob/main/NonLinearBinaryClassification.ipynb) - A binary classification problem with non-linearity.

## Useful Notes (Reference)

[Linear vs Non-Linear Activation Functions](https://github.com/VilPeas/TensorFlow/blob/main/Reference/LinearVsNonLinearActivations.ipynb) - Expolring various activation functions.

[Learning Rate Optimisation](https://github.com/VilPeas/TensorFlow/blob/main/Reference/LearningRateOptimisation.ipynb) - How to optimise the Learning Rate.

## Re-Used Functionality

- [Plot Library](https://github.com/VilPeas/TensorFlow/blob/main/PlotLibrary.py) - which contains the functionality that draws a decision boundary (used in various notebooks).
